Release note\nSeveral users have reported issues with components missing in the GAC after the installation. This issue only affects integration with Visual Studio 2008. We'll fix this issue in a subsequent release, the current workaround is to GAC these assemblies manually. The instructions are outlined below; we sincerely apologize for the inconvenience even though this is an alpha release:\n* Start a Visual Studio 2008 Command Prompt (on Vista, make sure you Run as Administrator)\n* Enter \"cd %programfiles%\\BdsSoft Linq to SharePoint\"\n* Execute the following commands:\n** gacutil -i BdsSoft.SharePoint.Linq.dll\n** gacutil -i BdsSoft.SharePoint.Linq.ObjectModelProvider.dll\n** gacutil -i BdsSoft.SharePoint.Linq.Tools.Spml.dll\n** gacutil -i BdsSoft.SharePoint.Linq.Tools.EntityGenerator.dll",
