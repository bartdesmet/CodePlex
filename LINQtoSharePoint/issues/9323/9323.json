    "Description": "Hi Bart,\n \nYour project adds tremendous value to Sharepoint development!\nIn trying my teeth on it I was able to create the spmetal file for accessing lists on a remote WSS3 server (albeit with empty Ids) but I was unable to generate the Linq Entities.\nMy dev environment is Win2003 SR1 with sp2 - running VS2008 Pro (RTM). I have copied your dlls to GAC per your instructions and downloaded the latest WSS SDK.\n \nRegards,\n \nDimitris Foukas",
