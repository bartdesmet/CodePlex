      "Message": "Indeed, there seems to be an issue with the assemblies being GAC'ed; we've seen this problem before. You should be able to work around it by GAC'ing the assemblies manually from the %programfiles%\\BdsSoft LINQ to SharePoint folder where copies should be installed. You should have the BdsSoft.SharePoint.Linq, BdsSoft.SharePoint.Linq.ObjectModelProvider, BdsSoft.SharePoint.Linq.Tools.EntityGenerator and BdsSoft.SharePoint.Linq.Tools.Spml assemblies in the GAC for tool support to work fine.\r\n\r\nHope this helps and sorry for the inconvenience,\r\n-Bart",
