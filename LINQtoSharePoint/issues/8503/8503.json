    "Description": "This is what I get, when using one of my lists:\n   SPML validation failed.\n   Schema validation messages:\n   - [ERROR] The 'Version' attribute is invalid - The value '285' is invalid according to its\n   datatype 'http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema:unsignedByte' - The string '285' is not a valid Byte value. (0,0)\n \nI have changed the SPML.xsd (in ..EntityGenerator) from\n   <xs:attribute name=\"Version\" type=\"xs:unsignedByte\" use=\"required\" />\nto\n   <xs:attribute name=\"Version\" type=\"xs:int\" use=\"required\" />\nbut I am not sure if this is OK.\n \nAfter the change, I now have the following error message:\n   Invalid Lookup field list reference encountered: list Docs referred to by field _CheckinComment\n   is unknown in the SharePoint context.\n \nAny ideas?\nCheers Harry",
