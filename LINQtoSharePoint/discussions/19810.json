We're limited indeed by what CAML can do (one design goal is to enforce explicitness to distinguish between local and remote execution) but this is definitely on the radar for further investigations. The way to accomplish aggregates today is like this:<br /><br />var totalPrice = (from p in ctx.Products select p.UnitPrice).AsEnumerable().Sum();<br /><br />where AsEnumerable() transitions from remote execution into local (LINQ to Objects) execution.<br /><br />Hope this helps,<br />-Bart<br />",
