When I query the User list using the following statement, say there are 5 entries\r\n in the User list,</p>\r\n<p><strong>var users = from u in context.User select u;</strong></p>\r\n<p>If all 5 entries have value (any # of value) in the CostCenters column, it will return me 5 (users).</p>\r\n<p>If any entry has empty CostCenters, the query will return <strong>null</strong> for the users. I actually still expect 5 users.</p>\r\n<p>Has anybody encountered the same issue? Is this a bug?</p>\r\n<p>I have spent a couple days trying to figure this out. If this doesn't work, that means I have to switch back to CAMLQuery... !@#!%!</p>\r\n<p>Thanks,</p>\r\n<p>Gary</p>\r\n",
