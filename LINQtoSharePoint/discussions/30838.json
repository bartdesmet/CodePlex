I think it's just what SharePoint needs to get the 'messy' data into something to code against. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nWhen I run spmetal against a document library I get the the following error: <br>\r\n<em><br>\r\nFailed to generate spml. Cannot load the list definition for docs</em><br>\r\n<br>\r\nThe library is a document library. (Perhaps it does not support doc libs?)<br>\r\n<br>\r\nDoes anyone know what this error is caused by?<br>\r\nThanks<br>\r\n",
