For example, suppose my SharePoint list has the following fields:<br /><br /><ul><li>Name</li><li>Title</li><li>ReportsTo (a lookup to the employee list)</li><li>ManagerOf (another lookup to the employee list)</li></ul><br />A record might appear on the site as:<br /><br /><ul><li>Bob Smith, IT Director, Joe Noonan, Mike Jones;Sarah Rose;Bill Dobbs</li></ul><br />I'd like to have returned a flat recordset that contains the following:<br /><br /><ul><li>Bob Smith, IT Director, Joe Noonan, Mike Jones</li><li>Bob Smith, IT Director, Joe Noonan, Sarah Rose</li><li>Bob Smith, IT Director, Joe Noonan, Bill Dobbs</li></ul><br />Is this possible with LINQ to SharePoint?<br />",
