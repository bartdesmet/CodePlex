I saw that the Sharepoint constructor that accepts a Uri object uses the <strong>WebServicesSharePointDataProvider</strong>. So I assume that's the way to connect to the site using&nbsp; the SharePoint webservices. The other construtor takes a <strong>ISharepointDataProvider</strong>, but the only <br>\r\ndefined in the <strong>BdsSoft.SharePoint.Linq.Providers</strong> namespace is the&nbsp;<strong>WebServicesSharePointDataProvider. </strong>So how do you connect using the object model?<strong> &nbsp;</strong> <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks<br>\r\nMichael<br>\r\n",
