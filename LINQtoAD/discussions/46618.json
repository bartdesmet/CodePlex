However, in my project I removed the change-set tracking because it caused huge performance problems for us and I removed ActiveDs because I don't like working with COM directly :p.  I also added support for Take and Order operations.  Anyone know how I would go about branching this project?  I reused a lot of the source code so i'm not sure what the ethics are behind branching it to another open source project.",

This post was quite some time ago and I'd really rather not have to assume the technical debt of pulling out your solution and replacing it with the LinqToLDAP solution. Please advise.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
