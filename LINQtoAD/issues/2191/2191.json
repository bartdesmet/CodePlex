    "Description": "This implementation has a drawback which might cause queries to fail unneccesarily. To fix this I suggest that settings for PageSize and ClientTimout are added to allow search pagning against the directory. This will enable retrieving more than a 1000 enties at one time and allow retrieving data from slow servers. I have attached a new version of DirectorySource.cs which implements these changes.",

In addition we'll provide a constructor overload that takes in a DirectorySearcher object that will be used to base the query parameters on, giving access to all the properties of DirectorySearcher rather than just the two mentioned in this suggestion.\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback,\r\n-Bart",
