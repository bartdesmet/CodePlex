    "Description": "I'd love to be able to write queries that hit both users and groups. Groups have a members property that is a string[] and Users have a Groups property tat is a string[], too. If these were a List<T> instead of a string[] we could cross query them much easier.\nÂ \nNice tool overall, though. But that's my wish :)",
