<div class="wikidoc"><h2>Introduction</h2>LINQ to Active Directory implements a custom LINQ query provider that allows querying objects in Active Directory. Internally, queries are translated into LDAP filters which are sent to the server using the System.DirectoryServices .NET Framework library. LINQ stands for Language Integrated Query and is one of the core features of Microsoft&#39;s .NET Framework 3.5 release. More information can be found via the MSDN website on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">http://msdn.microsoft.com</a>.<br />
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul><li>Translates into <b>LDAP filters</b> according to <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2254.html">RFC 2254</a>.</li>
<li>Simple and approachable <b>entity model</b> with support of propagating <b>updates</b> back.</li>
<li>Supports mappings to both the <b>System.DirectoryServices</b> (.NET) and <b>ActiveDs</b> (COM) APIs.</li>
<li>Ships with a set of <b>samples</b>.</li></ul>

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
This project is meant as a basic sample on implementing custom LINQ query providers. It hasn&#39;t been tested thoroughly and we do not provide any support whatsoever. Do not use it in a production environment without proper testing and validation of the technology&#39;s behavior. Users are most welcome to report issues and bugs through the Issue Tracker on this site.<br />
